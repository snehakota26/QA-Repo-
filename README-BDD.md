Setup and run Cucumber + Playwright BDD

Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Install Playwright browsers:

```bash
npm run install-browsers
```

Run the BDD scenarios (Cucumber):

```bash
npm run test:bdd
```

Browser scenarios have been replaced by the Azure Service Bus / Blob integration
scenarios, which are opt-in via the `@integration` tag.

Install the integration dependencies and create local configuration:

```powershell
npm install
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Start the MCP server from its cloned repository:

```powershell
cd ..\mcp-server
hatch env create
hatch run start
```

The MCP integration expects:

```text
MCP_SERVER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7071/mcp
```

Run MCP scenarios with:

```powershell
cd ..\AgenticAI
npm run test:integration:mcp
```

`pipeline-function` is a Service Bus queue-triggered function, not an HTTP
API. Its source contract can be checked locally without Azure credentials:

```powershell
npm run test:integration:pipeline
```

The live queue scenario requires these `.env` values:

```text
SERVICE_BUS_CONNECTION=<Service Bus connection string>
PIPELINE_QUEUE_NAME=cope-requests
PIPELINE_FUNCTION_REPO=../pipeline-function
```

Run it with:

```powershell
npm run test:integration:pipeline:live
```

Publishing a message only verifies that Service Bus accepted it. End-to-end
processing additionally requires the pipeline function, `AzureWebJobsStorage`,
Azure AI Foundry settings, and credentials described in the pipeline
repository's README.

Notes
- Feature files live in `specs/`.
- Cucumber World is `specs/support/world.js` which wires Playwright and page objects.
- Step definitions are in `specs/steps/`; integration steps are isolated in `integration.steps.js`.
